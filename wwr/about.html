            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>White Water Rafting Adventures was founded in 2005 by a group of passionate river enthusiasts who wanted to share the thrill and beauty of white-water rafting with the world. What started as a small operation with a couple of rafts and a dream has grown into one of the most respected rafting companies in the region. Over the years, we have expanded our fleet, trained a team of expert guides, and developed a variety of rafting trips to suit adventurers of all skill levels. Despite our growth, our core values of safety, adventure, and environmental responsibility remain unchanged. We are proud of our history and excited for the future as we continue to create unforgettable experiences on the water.</p>
